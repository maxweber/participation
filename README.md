# participation

A participation states that something (a participant) likes to participate in something else (the participation). It can be compared to the observer pattern, where the participation is the observable and the participant is the observer. But the participation pattern in contrast to the observer pattern is a functional construct. Unlike an observer the participant is a pure function and doesn't do any side effects. For that reason the participation invokes every registered participant and collects its result.
